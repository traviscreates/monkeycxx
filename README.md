# MonkeyCxx
My C++ implementation of Thorsten Ball's Monkey programming language

## Acknowledgments

The concepts and structure of this project owe a great debt to Thorsten's work. I highly recommended his book [*Writing An Interpreter in Go*](https://interpreterbook.com) for anyone interested in learning more about interpreters.
